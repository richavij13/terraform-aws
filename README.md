# Terraform Hands-on

Basic example of how to create an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform.

Now we will run the “terraform init” command where we created our instance.tf file to download and initialize the appropriate provider plugins. In this case, we are downloading the AWS provider plugin we specified in our main.tf file.

Once this is complete, let's run the “terraform plan” command. This will let us see what Terraform will do before we decide to apply it.

Now to create the instance, we run the “terraform apply” command.
